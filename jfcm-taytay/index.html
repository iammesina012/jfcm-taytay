      <h2 class="beliefs-title">WHY WE BELIEVE</h2>

      <div class="beliefs-grid">
        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">1</span>
          <p>
            We believe that the BIBLE is the infallible Word of God and the
            absolute authority in matters of faith and conduct.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">2</span>
          <p>
            We believe that God eternally exists in three distinct persons of
            the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">3</span>
          <p>
            We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Incarnate Word who was
            conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of Mary who was a virgin, and who
            died sacrificially for our sins. He was buried, resurrected bodily
            on the third day, ascended into heaven, and will come again to judge
            the living and the dead.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">4</span>
          <p>
            We believe that all men have sinned against God and that they are
            saved solely by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and His
            redemptive work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">5</span>
          <p>
            We believe that the Holy Spirit is the eternal Spirit of God sent to
            the church to empower it to live a holy life and to witness to the
            whole world.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">6</span>
          <p>
            We believe that there is only one church, the Body of Christ, with
            the Lord Jesus Christ as its head, and that all believers in every
            generation belong to it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">7</span>
          <p>
            We believe that the church is tasked by God to preach the gospel to
            all nations. This it can accomplish by planting churches and
            supporting mission through tithes and offerings.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">8</span>
          <p>
            We believe in the rapture of the saints, the second coming of
            Christ, the resurrection of the body, the judgment of believers, the
            judgment of non-believers, and in life everlasting.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">9</span>
          <p>
            We believe in the ordinances of Water Baptism and the Breaking of
            Bread.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="belief-card">
          <span class="belief-number">10</span>
          <p>
            We believe in the sanctity of marriage — that it is biblical,
            singular, and exclusively between man and woman.
